class OnlineMeanResultsHandler(ResultsHandler[T]):
    r"""
    `OnlineMeanResultsHandler` provides a numerically stable, online (incremental)
    algorithm to compute the arithmetic mean of large, streaming, or distributed
    datasets represented as NumPy arrays. In many real-world applications—such a
    distributed computing or real-time data processing—data is processed
    in batches, with each batch yielding a partial mean and its corresponding count.
    This class merges these partial results into a global mean without needing to
    store all the raw data, thus avoiding issues such as numerical overflow and
    precision loss.

    Suppose the overall dataset is divided into k batches.
    For each batch $i$ (where $1 \leq i \leq k$), let:

      - $m_i$ be the partial mean computed over $n_i$ data points.
      - $M_i$ be the global mean computed after processing $i$ batches.
      - $N_i = n_1 + n_2 + ... + n_i$ be the cumulative count after $i$ batches.

    The arithmetic mean of all data points is defined as:

    $$
    M_\text{total} = \frac{n_1 m_1 + n_2 m_2 + \ldots + n_k m_k}{n_1 + n_2 + \ldots + n_k}
    $$

    Rather than computing $M_{total}$ from scratch after processing all data,
    the class uses an iterative update rule. When merging a new partial result
    `(m_partial, n_partial)` with the current global mean `M_old` (with count
    `n_old`), the updated mean is given by:

    $$
    M_\text{new} = M_\text{old} + \left( m_\text{partial} - M_\text{old} \right) \cdot
        \frac{n_\text{partial}}{n_\text{old} + n_\text{partial}}
    $$

    This update is mathematically equivalent to the weighted average:

    $$
    M_\text{new} = \frac{n_\text{old} M_\text{old} + n_\text{partial} m_\text{partial}}{n_\text{old} + n_\text{partial}}
    $$

    but is rearranged to enhance numerical stability. By focusing on the
    difference `(m_partial - M_old)` and scaling it by the relative weight
    `n_partial / (n_old + n_partial)`, the algorithm minimizes the round-off
    errors that can occur when summing large numbers or when processing many
    batches sequentially.
